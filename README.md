# I'm Dmitriy aka ReasonMeThis

I have worn many hats throughout my career: theoretical physicist, professional poker player, science and philosophy blogger, DeFi and algorithmic trading enthusiast, AI assistant builder, and full-stack blockchain developer.

### Some stuff I made 

I'm currently working on my AI assistant DocDocGo ([live demo](https://docdocgo.streamlit.app), [code](https://github.com/reasonmethis/docdocgo-core/)), which was recently [featured](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/streamlit_ai-rag-chatgpt-activity-7189352534971486208-woYY/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by Streamlit. DocDocGo is a chatbot research assistant and can save you tons of time when you are looking for information that's not as easy to find as checking the first page of Google search results. It can perform what I've called _"infinite" web research_: it iteratively finds and ingests as much online content as needed on any topic, generates and continously refines a report, and forms a knowledge base from all fetched sources for follow-up questions. You can also create a knowledge base from your own documents, do keyword search, share your knowledge bases with other users and much more. You can have a conversation with it similar to how you'd interact with ChatGPT, and it's "self-aware": it knows its own documentation, so you can ask it for help using its various features and commands.

**[Bet Czar dApp](https://reasonmethis.github.io/bet-czar-frontend)** - manage and enforce bets on EVM blockchains. Has two components, each in a separate repo: (a) [the Hardhat project](https://github.com/reasonmethis/bet-czar-contract-solidity) with the Solidity contract, (b) [the frontend](https://github.com/reasonmethis/bet-czar-frontend), implemented with React, TypeScript, Material UI, Ethers. Currently deployed on the Goerli Ethereum testnet, so you can test it out with free test tokens - the site will point you in the right direction to get set up.

**[VocabMeThis](https://www.reasonmethis.com/2021/05/vocabmethis-measure-and-improve-your.html)** - a web app (Flask) to measure and improve the user's vocabulary. It ranks words by difficulty by constructing a frequency dictionary from NLTK corpora. It then suggests words to you whose difficulty level is chosen based on your measured vocabulary. It's great for English learners who want to learn words at just the right difficulty level.

My biggest past projects have to do with poker and crypto. See my [resume][resume] for details.

### Articles and posts

I am a big fan of physics and analytic philosophy. Here are some articles from my ReasonMeThis blog and from StackExchange:

and lots more where that came from.
