# I'm Dmitriy aka ReasonMeThis

I have worn many hats over my career: as a theoretical physicist, professional poker player, science & philosophy blogger, DeFi & algo trading aficionado, AI bot builder, and a full-stack blockchain developer.

### Some stuff I made 

I'm currently working on my AI bot DocDocGo ([live demo](https://docdocgo.streamlit.app), [repo](https://github.com/reasonmethis/docdocgo-core/)), which performs what I've called _"infinite" web research_: finds and ingests potentially hundreds of websites relevant to the topic you give it, generates an iteratively improving report, and forms a knowledge base from all fetched sources for follow-up questions. You can also create a knowledge base from your own documents, do keyword search, ask the bot itself for help using it, and much more.

**[Bet Czar dApp](https://reasonmethis.github.io/bet-czar-frontend)** - manage and enforce bets on EVM blockchains. Has two components, each in a separate repo: (a) [the Hardhat project](https://github.com/reasonmethis/bet-czar-contract-solidity) with the Solidity contract, (b) [the frontend](https://github.com/reasonmethis/bet-czar-frontend), implemented with React, TypeScript, Material UI, Ethers. Currently deployed on the Goerli Ethereum testnet, so you can test it out with free test tokens - the site will point you in the right direction to get set up.

**[VocabMeThis](https://www.reasonmethis.com/2021/05/vocabmethis-measure-and-improve-your.html)** - a web app (Flask) to measure and improve the user's vocabulary. It ranks words by difficulty by constructing a frequency dictionary from NLTK corpora. It then suggests words to you whose difficulty level is chosen based on your measured vocabulary. It's great for English learners who want to learn words at just the right difficulty level.

My biggest past projects have to do with poker and crypto. See my [resume][resume] for details.

### Articles and posts.

I am a big fan of physics and analytic philosophy. Here are some articles from my ReasonMeThis blog and from StackExchange:

* [Are you a Boltzmann brain?](https://www.reasonmethis.com/2021/02/are-you-boltzmann-brain.html)
* [Fine-tuning, multiverse, and monkeys with typewriters](https://www.reasonmethis.com/2021/01/fine-tuning-multiverse-and-monkeys.html)
* [The lottery fallacy](https://www.reasonmethis.com/2021/03/the-lottery-fallacy.html)

and lots more where that came from.
